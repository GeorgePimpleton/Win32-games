# Win32 Games, Chapter 2: Blizzard

Win9X/Me is officially dead!

Blizzard, from the 2004 CD, creates and uses the Game Engine class

Blizzard (original) - Original CD game files

Blizzard (pass 1) - The bare minimum changes to work with modern C++/Win32 x86 & x64.  SAL is a minimum.

Blizzard (pass 2) - Reformatting, changing some file names and refining the code for Unicode and modern Windows OSes.  Added my Random Toolkit to generate random numbers the C++ way.
