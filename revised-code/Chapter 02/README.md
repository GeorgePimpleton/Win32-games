# Win32 Games, Chapter 2

### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Blizzard: Creating An Engine For Games

Blizzard, creates and uses the Game Engine class.  From the 2004 CD.

### Blizzard Versions

0. Original CD game files written in 2004.
1. The bare minimum changes to work with modern C++/Win32 x86 & x64.  SAL is a minimum.
2. Reformatting, changing some file names and refining the code for Unicode and modern Windows OSes.  Added my Random Toolkit to generate random numbers the C++ way.
3. Added menus, inline the setters and getters and other misc. changes.
4. Use C++ smart pointers, shared and unique, instead of raw pointers.
5. Changed the shared pointers to unique, any WCHAR string arrays in the Game Engine class are now std::wstring.

Is pass 5 the final version?  Probably, but maybe not.  Depends on later game code that is updated to use smart pointers.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon.  There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code don't hesitate to let me know.

### Musings on WindowsÂ© Games

To be honest the game engine created is hard to convert to modern C++ practices.  More and more it is looking like the game engine needs to be rewritten from top to bottme from scratch.
