# Win32 Games, Chapter 3

### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Trippy: Learning to Draw Basic Graphics

Trippy shows how to do basic drawing using Win32 GDI.  From the 2003 CD.

### Trippy Versions

0. Original CD game files written in 2003.

1. update the old code to the new standard I set for Blizzard.

Is this the final version?  Probably, but maybe not.  Depends on later game code that is updated from the original.

Possible updated version(s), use GDI+ and/or DirectX instead of GDI.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon.  There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code don't hesitate to let me know.

### Musings on WindowsÂ© Games

To be honest the game engine created is hard to convert to modern C++ practices.  More and more it is looking like the game engine needs to be rewritten from top to bottme from scratch.
