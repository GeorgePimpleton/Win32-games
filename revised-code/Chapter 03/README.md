# Win32 Games, Chapter 3: Trippy

Win9X/Me is officially dead!

Trippy shows how to do basic drawing using Win32 GDI.  From the 2003 CD.

Versions:

Blizzard, orginal: Original CD game files written in 2003.

Blizzard, pass 1: update the old code to the new standard I set for Blizzard.

Is this the final version?  Probably, but maybe not.  Depends on later game code that is updated from the original.

Possible updated version(s), use GDI+ and/or DirectX instead of GDI.
