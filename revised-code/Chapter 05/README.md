# Win32 Games, Chapter 5: UFO

Win9X/Me is officially dead!

Slideshow demonstrates how to interact with a game using the keyboard and mouse.

Versions:

UFO, orginal: Chapter 6 on 2003 CD.  The program files are also on Chapter 5 2004 CD.

UFO, pass 1: modernized code...

Is this the final version?  Probably, but maybe not.  Depends on later game code that is updated from the original.

Possible updated version(s), use GDI+ and/or DirectX.  DX input control is different than the Win32 methods.
