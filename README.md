# Programming Windows Games

I own a couple of OLD books about creating 2D games using the Windows API.

I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and the newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files are copyrighted Â© 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing, they is not my work.

There are no executables included, they need to be created by compiling the sources.

I use Visual Studio 2022 (Community) to update and test the game code, setting the C++ language standard to C++20.

### Notes

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon.
