I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and the newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files are copyrighted Â© 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing, they is not my work.

There are no executables included, they need to be created by compiling the sources.
