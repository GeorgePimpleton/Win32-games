### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Why this repository exists
I own a couple of OLD (© 2003 & 2004) books about creating 2D games using the Windows API.

I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files, archived here in 7zip format, are copyright © 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing. The source files and resulting games are not my work.
