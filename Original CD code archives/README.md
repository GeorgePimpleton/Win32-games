### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Why this repository exists

I own a couple of OLD (© 2003 & 2004) books about creating 2D games using the Windows API.

I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and the newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files archived here are copyright © 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing, the source files and resulting games are not my work.

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

### Musings on Windows© Games

To be honest parts of the game engine created are hard to convert to modern C++ practices.  More and more it is looking like the game engine needs to be rewritten top to bottom from scratch.  *UGH*
