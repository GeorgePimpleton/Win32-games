### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

## What is GDI+?
GDI+ is considered to be a deprecated C++ enhancement to Windows' GDI, graphics only.  I still find it acceptable to use.

Using GDI+: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-using-gdi--use

There are samples available, 'classic' (Not UWP) samples: https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples

Not all of the games will be replicated to use GDI+.
