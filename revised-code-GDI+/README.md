# Programming Windows© Games Using GDI+

### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Why this repository exists

I own a couple of OLD books about creating 2D games using the Windows API.

I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and the newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files are copyrighted © 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing, they is not my work.

There are no executables included, they need to be created by compiling the sources.

I currently use Visual Studio 2022 (Community) to update and test the game code, setting the C++ language standard to C++20.  You should too.  It's free.

GDI+ is considered to be a deprecated C++ enhancement to Windows' GDI, graphics only.  I still find it acceptable to use.

Using GDI+: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-using-gdi--use

There are samples available, 'classic' (Not UWP) samples: https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples

Not all of the games will be replicated to use GDI+.
