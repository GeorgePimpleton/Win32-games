### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Why this repository exists

I own a couple of OLD books about creating 2D games using the Windows API.

I've spent a lot of time, years, updating and revising this pre-C++11 code to work with modern Windows and the newer C++ language standards.

The original source code and media files are copyrighted © 2003 & 2004 by Samspublishing, they is not my work.

There are no executables included, they need to be created by compiling the sources.

I currently use Visual Studio 2022 (Community) to update and test the game code, setting the C++ language standard to C++20.  You should too.  It's free.

##

GDI+ is considered to be a deprecated C++ enhancement to Windows' GDI, graphics only.  I still find it acceptable to use.

Using GDI+: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdiplus/-gdiplus-using-gdi--use

There are samples available, 'classic' (Not UWP) samples: https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples

Not all of the games will be replicated to use GDI+.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
