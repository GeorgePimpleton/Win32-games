### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### UFO 2: Improving Input with Joysticks

0. Chapter 7 on 2003 CD.  The program files are also on Chapter 7 2004 CD.
1. minimal changes to compile.
2. **modernized code...** *<----- this example*

There is no need for having a menu option to start a new game, so the menu item is started as being disabled and never enabled.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
