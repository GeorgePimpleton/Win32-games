### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Roids 2: Teaching Games to Think

0. Chapter 20 on 2003 CD, chapter 18 on 2004 CD.
1. **minimal revisions...** *<----- this example*
2. modernized code...

## WARNING!

The layout of the frames in the bitmap files between the two editions are different, with the animation code in the game engine being different!  "There be dragons here!" if you mix and match bitmap files and game source code from the 2003 and 2004 versions.  I use the game source from the 2004 edition.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
