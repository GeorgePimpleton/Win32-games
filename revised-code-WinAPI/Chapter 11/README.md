### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Example Game: Henway
0. Chapter 12 on 2003 CD, chapter 11 on 2004 CD.
1. minimal update...
2. modernized code...

### Notes
There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

I prefer the images from 2003, there is just something 'off' about the 2004 images.  The chicken looks weird.
