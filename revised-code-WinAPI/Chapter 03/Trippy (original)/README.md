### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Trippy: Learning to Draw Basic Graphics

Trippy shows how to do basic drawing using Win32 GDI.  From the 2003 CD.

### Trippy Versions

0. **Original CD game files written in 2003.** *<----- this example*
1. update the old code to the new standard I set for Blizzard.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
