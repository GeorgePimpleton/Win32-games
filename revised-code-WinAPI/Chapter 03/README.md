### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Trippy: Learning to Draw Basic Graphics
Trippy shows how to do basic drawing using Win32 GDI.  From the 2003 CD.  There is a different example on the 2004 CD, CropCircles.

### Trippy Versions
0. original CD game files written in 2003.
1. minimum revisions needed to work with modern WindowsÂ© compilers.
2. updated with menus/About... dialog, fully modern WinAPI compliance and using smart pointers

Personally I like Blizzard, trying to update 2004's exmaple is a lot of hard work when using the RTK header.
