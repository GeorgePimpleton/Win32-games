### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Trippy: Learning to Draw Basic Graphics

Trippy shows how to do basic drawing using Win32 GDI.  From the 2003 CD.  There is a different example on the 2004 CD, CropCircles.

### Trippy Versions

0. original CD game files written in 2003.
1. minimum revisions needed to work with modern WindowsÂ© compilers.
2. **updated with menus/About... dialog, fully modern WinAPI compliance and using smart pointers.** *<----- this example*

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
