### Blizzard Versions
4. Added my Random Toolkit (v 1.3.1.2) header to help generate random numbers the C++ way.

### Notes
There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

Occasionally I use a previous version of my RTK (v 1.3.1) to ease code transition when using WinAPI min/max functions.
