### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Blizzard: Creating An Engine For Games
Blizzard, creates and uses the Game Engine class.  Used code from the 2004 CD.

### Blizzard Versions
0. Original CD game files written in 2004.  If you can get this code to work, more power to ya.
1. The bare minimum changes to work with modern C++/WinAPI x86 & x64.
2. Removed the old WinAPI Hungarian Notation from variables.  Even MS recommends not using it.
3. Changed file names.
4. Added my Random Toolkit header to help generate random numbers the C++ way.
5. Refined the code for Unicode only and modern Windows OSes.
6. Added a main menu with accelerators.
7. Use C++ strings instead of Windows string pointers.
8. Use C++ smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
