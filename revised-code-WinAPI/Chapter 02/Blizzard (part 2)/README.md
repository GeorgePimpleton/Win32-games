### Blizzard Versions
2. Removed the old WinAPI Hungarian Notation from variable names.

Even MS recommends not using it with new code, C++ guidelines certainly suggest against using it.

[Hungarian Notation, what is it?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/windows-coding-conventions#hungarian-notation)

[NL.5: Avoid encoding type information in names](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rl-name-type)

If you see old WinAPI code you will see Hungarian Notation used.  Lots and lots of it.

I will use a form of notation to indicate when a variable is a class data member or a global.

I changed the macro definition numbers.
