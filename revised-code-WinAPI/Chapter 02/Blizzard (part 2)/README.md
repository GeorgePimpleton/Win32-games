### Blizzard Versions

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
