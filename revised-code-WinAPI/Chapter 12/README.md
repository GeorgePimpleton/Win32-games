### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Brainiac 2: Playing Digital Sound Effects/Wave Files
0. Chapter 14 on 2003 CD, chapter 12 on 2004 CD.
1. minimal rework for modern WinAPI...
2. modernized code...
   + alternative graphics...
   
I like the game tile artwork from 2003 more than the artwork from 2004.
