### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Example Game: Light Cycles
0. Chapter 8 on 2004 CD.
1. minimal update...
2. modernized code...used std::array 2 dimensional containers instead of a 2D std::vector

Remember the light cycle duel from the movie "Tron?"
