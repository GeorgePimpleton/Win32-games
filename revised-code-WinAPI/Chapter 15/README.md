### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Battle Office 2: Animating the Appearance of Sprites
0. Chapter 17 on 2003 CD, chapter 15 on 2004 CD.
1. minimal revision...
2. modernized code...

## \*\****WARNING!***\*\*
The layout of the frames in the bitmap files between the two book editions are different, with the animation code in the game engine being different!  "There be dragons here!" if you mix and match bitmap files and game source code from the 2003 and 2004 versions.

The 2003 animation bitmap frames are laid out horizontally, the 2004 bitmaps vertically.

For this example only I use the game source from the 2003 edition.  For the rest of the examples I use the source from 2004.
