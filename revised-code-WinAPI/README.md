### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.

### Musings on Windows© Games

To be honest the game engine created so many years ago is hard to convert to modern C++ practices.  It isn't bad code, it just resists being modernized.  More and more it is looking like the game engine needs to be rewritten from top to bottom from scratch.  *UGH*
