### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Slideshow: Drawing Graphical Images

Slideshow demonstrates how to load bitmap files from a file or as a Win32 resource.  Introduces the Bitmap class.

### Slideshow Versions

0. **Chapter 5 on 2003 CD.  The program files are also on Chapter 4 2004 CD.  Each version of Slideshow has different pictures.** *<----- this example*
1. Replaced all the gawd-awful C-style "load a bitmap" code to use the Win32 LoadImage function instead.  Why reinvent a flat wheel when the Win API, even the antique GDI, has built-in support.  The books' author even admits he had to get help to write that code.  \**Ouch!*\*

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
