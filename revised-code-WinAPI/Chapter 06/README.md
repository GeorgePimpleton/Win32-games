### Background
Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Example Game: Brainiac
0. Chapter 8 on 2003 CD.  The program files are also on Chapter 6 2004 CD.
1. Minimal WinAPI updates
2. modernized code...
3. Added "New Game" menu feature
4. Updated the logic so a new game can only be started when a previous game was won
   + An alternate set of graphics.  Same game code.
   
I like the game tile artwork from 2003 more than the artwork from 2004.
