### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Example Game: Brainiac

0. Chapter 8 on 2003 CD.  The program files are also on Chapter 6 2004 CD.
1. modernized code...

Is this the final version?  Probably, but maybe not.  Depends on later game code that is updated from the original.

Possible updated version(s), use GDI+ and/or DirectX.  DX input control is different than the Win32 methods.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon or to what degree of modern usage.

There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code please drop me a note and let me know.
