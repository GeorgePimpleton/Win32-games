The basics of programming using the Windows API, in a quick nutshell.  

### Background

Win9X/Me is officially dead!  Windows API ANSI encoding is dead!  Windows XP and later now use Unicode!

Windows and C/C++ have changed since 2003/2004.  Programmers need to adapt.

### Possible types of apps that can be created on Windows

1. console mode using C++
    + console mode using C++20's modules
2. **using a custom C++ header file to use C++11 (and later) random engine features instead of the C library functions** *<----- this example*
    + **using a custom C\+\+20 module to use C++11 (and later) random engine features instead of the C library functions** *<----- this example*
3. a Windows API MessageBox
    + a WinAPI MessageBox using modern coding
4. a minimal WinAPI app
     + a minimal WinAPI app using modern coding
5. a minimal skeletal WinAPI app
6. a realistic skeletal WinAPI app with custom assets
7. a skeletal WinAPI app using C++ wide strings using modernized C++ practices 
8. a minimum MFC app
9. modularizing WinAPI
10. modularizing WinAPI
11. modularizing WinAPI
12. modularizing WinAPI
13. modularizing WinAPI

This example uses a header only toolkit to make it easier to use the C++ random engine features.

The example code requires C++20, the header only toolkit doesn't.

### Notes

There may be links to websites or internet sources in these pages and source code. Links can go stale. A search engine is your friend.

This is a "work in progress", there is no guarantee the entirety of the entire collection of games will ever be modernized any time soon.  There is also no guarantee the source files will work for you.

If you find better ways to rework the code don't hesitate to let me know.
